# 100+ Trees Pack
_____________________
## How to use

The tree prefabs are located in the "Prefabs" folder for each category. Any prefab comes with an LOD Group and should be ready to be used as it is.
Shaders and associated materials are in the "Materials" folder.
> The included materials are based on **shadergraphs**, thus they will appear pink if you are not compatible with shadergraphs.

You can also use the meshes individually and apply your own materials, but please note that every tree mesh is composed of **2 submeshes**, the first for the trunk/branches, the second for the leaves. Thus, you **must** put 2 materials in the renderer and they will automatically be applied on the trunk (1st material) and the leaves (2nd material). Every missing material will cause the associated submesh to render as plain pink color.
Meshes are located in the "Meshes" folder for every category. The level of details of every mesh is indexed by a suffix in its name.
> e.g. `High/Meshes/tree5_2.asset` corresponds to the 3rd level of details of the 5th tree mesh from the "High" category.

Finally, a simple demo scene is accessible in the "Scenes" folder.
